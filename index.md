### *Ricci Flow FX Topological Trading System*

Welcome to the official public release of the **RF‑FXTTS Whitepaper**, a structural, topological and ecosystem‑based model of the FX market.

This site provides an accessible, web‑friendly version of the project and links to the full documentation.

## 🧠 What is RF‑FXTTS?

## Risk Distribution Across 28 Pairs

![Risk Distribution](./images/risk_distribution_28_pairs_corrected.png)

RF‑FXTTS models the FX market not as 28 isolated currency pairs, but as a **closed 8‑currency ecosystem** — a complete graph (K₈) with 28 structural edges.

The system describes:

- pressure flow  
- structural deformation  
- correlation displacement  
- symmetry restoration  
- Ricci‑like smoothing cycles  

This creates a **prediction‑free**, antifragile trading architecture based on structural alignment.
