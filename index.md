## 🧠 What is RF‑FXTTS?

## Risk Distribution Across 28 Pairs

![Risk Distribution](./images/risk_distribution_28_pairs_corrected.png)

RF‑FXTTS models the FX market not as 28 isolated currency pairs, but as a **closed 8‑currency ecosystem** — a complete graph (K₈) with 28 structural edges.

The system describes:

- pressure flow  
- structural deformation  
- correlation displacement  
- symmetry restoration  
- Ricci‑like smoothing cycles  

This creates a **prediction‑free**, antifragile trading architecture based on structural alignment.

### 📘 Related Work by the Author

This project is conceptually connected to the author's book:

**The Gospel of Financial Nirvana:  
The Path Out of the Wheel of Financial Samsara**

The book explores how most market participants remain trapped in a recurring cycle of expectation, fear, profit, and loss — a financial analogue of samsara.  
Its core message aligns with the RF‑FXTTS paradigm:

- prediction cannot control the market  
- errors are inevitable and structurally necessary  
- clarity and boundaries matter more than forecasts  

The RF‑FXTTS ecosystem translates these principles into practice —  
replacing prediction with structure, and control with viability.
